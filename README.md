## Out of Scope
While NihonGo aims to provide a comprehensive learning experience, the following features are considered out of scope for the current version:

- **Connection with Backend Server:** NihonGo does not include a backend server integration in the current implementation. The focus is on the frontend functionality and user experience. However, you can refer to the backend repository for guidance on how to integrate the frontend with a backend server for authentication and database operations.
- **Kana Stroke Order Practice:** Although stroke order is an important aspect of learning Japanese characters, NihonGo does not include specific stroke order practice exercises.
- **Kanji Lessons:** NihonGo primarily focuses on Hiragana and Katakana learning, and does not currently provide comprehensive Kanji lessons.
- **AI-Powered Quizzes and Spaced Repetition System:** Advanced features such as AI-powered quizzes and a Spaced Repetition System for optimized learning schedules are not included in the current version.

Please note that these out-of-scope features may be considered for future updates or enhancements to NihonGo.
